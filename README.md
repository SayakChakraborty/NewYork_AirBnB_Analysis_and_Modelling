## RPubs: https://rpubs.com/SayakChakraborty/NewYorkAirBnB_Modelling

The Data was collected from Kaggle. In this project we present to you exploratory data analysis, visualizations and modelling of New York Airbnb data. Airbnb, Inc.is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. Revenue for Airbnb comes from its guests and hosts: hosts are charged 3% of the value of the booking, while guests are charged 6%-12% per the nature of the booking. Airbnb market is quite blooming in New York city (NYC) which had more than 48,000 listings as of August-2019 calendar year.

We focus on New York Cityâ€™s data as we wish to perform an in-depth analysis on one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

In this project, we also try to predict the factors that affect the pricing of the airbnbs around New York. This includes creating different kind of models, model specification, transformation, variable selection and many more.

We carried out the project in the following steps:

* Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Data Visualization
* Modelling and Model Checking
* Finalising the Model
* Prediction using the Final Model.
